<p style="text-align: center;">Since I first started experimenting with SDRs, I manage to receive quite a lot of different signal bands varying from HF, NOAA APT, Meteor LRPT, AIS, and all the way to L-Band & C-Band. I was intrigued to try as many of them as I could primarily out of curiosity to experience them myself. But I always had interference issues beyond Broadcast FM band mostly from that same FM stations and other terrestrial signals. So I didn't think much about exploring VHF/UHF bands for a long time.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I made an "End Fed Half-Wave" for 80m-10m a few months back and it worked great beyond all my expectations. I was able to receive a wide range of interesting signals including local fisherman chatter on 40m/20m, daily rag chew of the local radio society on 40m, CW weather stations from Japan on 60m, and also a few DRM stations from Romania with it. Recently I was bored listening to more or less the same stuff on HF and finally decided to explore the world of VHF/UHF.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I didn't have a suitable antenna for VHF/UHF bands so I decided to build one myself. I did some research on the best VHF/UHF antennas and there were so many options. I also asked a <a href="https://twitter.com/dereksgc">friend</a> about his thoughts and he suggested I should build a Log-Periodic and try my luck with it. So I got to work...</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I used this <a href="https://www.changpuak.ch/electronics/lpda.php">online calculator</a> to calculate the measurements for my antenna and decided to make it for 100MHz - 950MHz.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I decided to make it entirely out of aluminum because I need it to be sturdy but lightweight. I got some 3/8 inch aluminum tubes for the elements and 1-inch aluminum box bars for the two booms. I was able to make it quite accurately and using aluminum pop reverts to secure everything in place was a great choice which made it much stronger than I anticipated.</p>

<p>After that, I mounted it horizontally 30 feet high on a pole and scanned through bands to see what can I receive. I was able to receive some encrypted police communications, some faint VHF activity towards the sea, and narrow telemetry beacons which I believe from some CubeSats and at one time NOAA APT and Meteor_M2 LRPT...</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Then as I going up in bands suddenly i stumbled upon a much wider signal, which I thought was interference or electrical noise at first. When I switched to 10Msps on my Airspy R2 to see it clearly, I could see two FM downlinks right beside that signal. So I turned to one of them and I could hear the sound of a TV commercial very clearly. As it turned out it was from a local Analog TV station and lucky for me there was already a plug-in for decoding them on SDRSharp called PAL/NTSC Decoder. So I launched the plug-in, tuned in to the video signal, and sure enough, as I checked the video check box it started decoding the video. Then I tuned back into FM audio signal and I had both video and sound...</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Unfortunately, there is no way to decode color as of this time, but you can clearly see the color burst subcarrier visible between the vision and audio carriers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Even though Sri Lanka has been mostly moved to satellite-TV broadcast like the rest of the world, analog TV is still in use. I'm glad I got to receive it before it went extinct forever.</p>

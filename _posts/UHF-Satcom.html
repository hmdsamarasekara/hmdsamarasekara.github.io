<p style="text-align:justify;">The United States military has a worldwide UHF geostationary satellite network operating in the 243MHz-270MHz (Downlink) range and 292MHz-318MHz (Uplink) range in FM. These serve as repeaters and are intended for radio communication between military ground stations, ships, aircraft, etc without needing expensive antenna systems. But since these satellite uplinks do not have access control, they have been misused by third parties for quite a long time. Mostly truck drivers, Illegal loggers, drug dealers, mafia, and some regular people...</p>

<p style="text-align:jstify;">I managed to receive the infamous 255.550MHz downlink which is extremely active throughout the day with my home brew Eggbeater antenna.</p>
